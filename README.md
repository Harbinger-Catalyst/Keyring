# \# ROOT.KEYRING.EXE

# 

# A local-first, browser-based password manager with a focus on giving tech-savvy vibes through the user interface. All credentials are encrypted and stored entirely in your browser — no servers, no accounts, no network calls.

# 

# \## Features

# 

# \- \*\*AES-GCM-256 encryption\*\* — vault data is encrypted with a 256-bit key before being written to `localStorage`

# \- \*\*PBKDF2 key derivation\*\* — 310,000 iterations with SHA-256 to derive the encryption key from your master password

# \- \*\*Zero network calls\*\* — everything runs locally in the browser; credentials never leave your device

# \- \*\*Auto-lock\*\* — vault locks automatically after 5 minutes of inactivity

# \- \*\*Tab-switch lock\*\* — vault locks instantly when you switch away from the tab

# \- \*\*Password generator\*\* — configurable length (8–64 chars) with uppercase, digits, and symbol toggles

# \- \*\*Password strength meter\*\* — real-time visual strength bar on all password fields

# \- \*\*Favorites\*\* — star entries for quick access in the Favorites tab

# \- \*\*Search\*\* — full-text search across website, email, username, and notes

# \- \*\*Sortable list\*\* — sort by name, creation date, or last modified date

# \- \*\*Export\*\* — download your vault as JSON or CSV

# \- \*\*Edit \& delete\*\* — update any credential with a confirmation prompt on delete

# \## Tech Stack

# 

# | Layer | Library |

# |---|---|

# | Framework | React 19 + TypeScript |

# | Build tool | Vite 7 with `vite-plugin-singlefile` |

# | Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |

# | Animations | Framer Motion |

# | Utilities | clsx, tailwind-merge |

# 

# \## Getting Started

# 

# \*\*Prerequisites:\*\* Node.js 18+

# 

# ```bash

# \# Install dependencies

# npm install

# 

# \# Start development server

# npm run dev

# 

# \# Build for production (outputs a single self-contained HTML file)

# npm run build

# 

# \# Preview production build

# npm run preview

# ```

# 

# The production build (`npm run build`) generates a single portable `index.html` file via `vite-plugin-singlefile` — no separate JS or CSS assets required.

# 

# \## Security Notes

# 

# \- Your master password is \*\*never stored or transmitted\*\*. If you forget it, the vault is permanently unrecoverable.

# \- The vault is stored in `localStorage` under the key `password\_manager\_vault\_v1` as an encrypted blob (`salt` + `iv` + `cipherText`).

# \- A random 16-byte salt and 12-byte IV are generated fresh on every save, so re-encrypting the same data always produces a different ciphertext.

# \- The minimum master password length is 12 characters.
